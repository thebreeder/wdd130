        <p>Hello everyone, I'm really, really excited to be here. I'm a big fan of education itself. I think that's why I'm a teacher, lol. I'm here for the whole nine yards and more. I'm planning to complete an Applied Technology BS degree, like some of my peers. I love technology, and all that makes technology better just amazes me. I also enjoy sports like soccer, football, and basketball. But the hobby I love most is spending time with my kids; they just fulfill my inner child and don't let me get old... inside, of course, lol.</p>
        <p>Talking about my family, I'm married to a great woman who loves our kids and enjoys my annoying, immature self. Please don't mention that to her :) I've been an English teacher for the past eight years. I love my job because my methodology is all about games and practice; it just never gets boring. But in my country, teachers are just not well-paid as they should be, so I want to pursue my next passion, technology, and programming.</p>   <p>So far, I've enjoyed every pathway and BYU-Idaho course. I'm still nervous, but these courses give me the opportunity to learn and work at the same time. Thanks, BYU-Idaho. Like I said earlier, I want to pursue my next passion but also earn a better living and provide a better lifestyle for my family.</p>
        <p>I've been a member of the church for about 25 years. God and family are my main passion. I can't imagine my life without God in my heart. One quote I have always enjoyed is from Elder Rafael E. Pino of the Seventy: "I pray that our normality may allow us to experience that state of 'never-ending happiness' (Mosiah 2:41)." Living by the commandments of God just blesses everything.</p>
        <p>I hope this surpasses all my expectations and I'm really looking forward to working with all my peers.</p>
        <p>Thank you.
