    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>

Our mission is to ensure the safety and well-being of both adventurers and rescue teams by offering expertly bred, highly trained canine companions.

    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p>In building our website, we are deeply attentive to the distinct needs and demographics of our primary audience, which includes rafting company representatives, search and rescue coordinators, outdoor enthusiasts, emergency response professionals, and prospective dog owners. Rafting companies, often managed by individuals in their 30s to 50s, seek to enhance safety protocols and protect their clients' well-being. Search and rescue teams, similarly aged, are searching for highly trained water rescue dogs to boost response efficiency. Outdoor enthusiasts of various ages desire knowledge about the role of rescue dogs in rafting safety and aspire to gain confidence in their safety measures. Recognizing the existing gaps in information accessibility for our target groups, our website will provide clear messaging, compelling storytelling, educational resources, testimonials, and easy contact options. To visually engage our audience, we will employ a color palette inspired by aquatic and earthy tones and utilize readable fonts such as RocknRoll One or Roboto. A user-friendly design will ensure compatibility across desktops, laptops, and mobile devices, while seamless social media integration will foster community engagement and raise awareness of our mission. Through this holistic approach, we aim to meet the specific demands of our diverse audience effectively.</p>
